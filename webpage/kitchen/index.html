                <h1><em><b>My Favorite Recipes</b></em></h1>
                <p>Here are some recent treats I’ve made. I am a big fan of Claire Saffitz. You may know her from Gourmet Makes on YouTube. Now, she has her own YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ClaireSaffitzxDessertPerson">Claire Saffitz Dessert Person</a>, named after her first cookbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dessert-Person-Recipes-Guidance-Confidence/dp/1984826964">Dessert Person</a>. So far, I have made two of her cookie recipes and they were home runs. Brown butter is the unsung hero in these cookies and brings out a salty, savory, caramel, and deep butterscotch flavor that balances with the other flavors perfectly. These pair perfectly with ice cream for ice cream sandwiches.</p>
                <p>In addition to cookies, I also love making cakes, pudding, and pies. I am also a big fan of coconut, so when I was trying to decide what to make for Easter, I ended up making coconut cream pie from <cite>The New York Times Cooking</cite> recipe. This pie was the star of the show and was beloved by everyone, young and old. It was soft, creamy, rich but light, fluffy, easy to make, and full of coconut flavor. Months later, my family still compliments that coconut cream pie and they cannot wait to see what I make for next Easter. I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as I did. Enjoy!</p>
