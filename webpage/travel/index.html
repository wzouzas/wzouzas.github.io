            <h2><img src="/Users/williamzouzas/Documents/Senior Year (Fall 2021)/GUI Programming/GUI HW1/webpage/travel/images/kimball.jpg" width="250" class="align-right">Kimball Farm in Westford, MA</h2>
            <p>They have ice cream, an arcade, mini-golf, seafood, bumper boats (like bumper cars but in the water), and did I say ice cream already? This is a local spot that is very nostalgic for me. My family, cousins, and relatives frequented this spot often during childhood. Many birthdays and celebrations took place here. The ice cream pictured here includes raspberry chocolate chip and chocolate, both in cones. </p>

            <h2><img src="/Users/williamzouzas/Documents/Senior Year (Fall 2021)/GUI Programming/GUI HW1/webpage/travel/images/buttermilk.jpg" width="250" class="align-left">Buttermilk and Bourbon in Boston, MA</h2>
            <p>Have you ever been to Newbury Street in Boston, Massachusetts? There are a lot of stores and restaurants on Newbury Street. It is pretty busy on weekends and especially busy during the summer. If you ever want to go out to eat somewhere less busy or less frequented, Buttermilk and Bourbon is great option because it is located on Commonwealth Avenue, a residential street right next to Newbury Street. It is a lot less frequented since there are no shops or restaurants other than Buttermilk and Bourbon, which takes inspiration from Southern cuisine, if you couldn’t tell from the name. My foodie friend and I loved this tapas style restaurant. We started with a delicious wedge salad with avocado and then some shrimp cocktail. For our main course, we shared a plate of fried chicken sliders. Finally, we polished off hot beignets topped with icing sugar and served with coffee soft serve.
