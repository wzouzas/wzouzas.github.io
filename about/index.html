                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is William Zouzas, and over the past couple years I have grown a passion for baking and cooking at home in my kitchen. I love to find new recipes and try new things, even if I am not sure if the end result will be tasty or satisfying. I like baking the best, since I have a sweet tooth, but I am also very good at cooking and grilling.</p>
                <p>I am Greek American, which I am truly grateful for because Greek food is the best food out there. I learned a lot about baking and cooking from my parents and especially grandparents who would always spend extra time teaching us the names of traditional Greek dishes. They would also quiz our smelling skills for herbs and spices. Out of these experiences I have grown to love baking and cooking in the kitchen. 
                </p>
                <p>This website is an amalgamation of my passions for consuming and creating good food. By good food, I mean food that is good for the heart and the soul. Keep exploring to find out about my culinary experiences. Also, feel free to follow my journey through social media.</p>
